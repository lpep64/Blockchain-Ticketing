### Project Overview
This project aims to address the issue of black-market ticket resales at the University of Connecticut (UConn) by developing a secure, blockchain-based ticketing system. The system ensures fair access to UConn athletic events for all students by linking each ticket to the purchaser's student ID and requiring both the ticket and ID for entry.

### Key Features
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes blockchain technology to securely manage and distribute student tickets.
- **Secure Ticket Distribution**: Ensures tickets are distributed fairly and securely, even during high-demand periods.
- **Administrative Control**: Only authorized administrators can transfer tickets, preventing unauthorized resales.
