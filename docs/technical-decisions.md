| Total Weighted Score            | 4.85         | 4.00         | 4.10         | 3.70         |

Note: Each cell contains the raw score (0-5) and the weighted score in parentheses.

## Criteria Explanations:

1. **Ease of Use (15%)**: How intuitive and straightforward the framework is for developers.
2. **Performance (20%)**: Runtime performance of applications built with the framework.
3. **Community Support (10%)**: Size and activity of the developer community, availability of resources.
4. **Integration with Backend (15%)**: Ease of integration with various backend technologies, particularly important for our blockchain-based system.
5. **Ecosystem & Libraries (15%)**: Availability of third-party libraries and tools, crucial for rapid development.
6. **Mobile Development (10%)**: Capabilities for developing mobile applications, considering potential future expansion.
7. **Familiarity (Team) (15%)**: Current team's experience with the technology, important for immediate productivity.

## Analysis:

1. **React (4.85)**: Scores highest overall, excelling in performance, community support, and ecosystem. The team's familiarity is a significant advantage.

2. **Vue (4.10)**: Performs well in ease of use and performance, but slightly lower in backend integration and ecosystem compared to React.

3. **Angular (4.00)**: Strong in backend integration and ecosystem, but lower scores in ease of use and team familiarity impact its overall rating.

4. **Svelte (3.70)**: Excellent in ease of use and performance, but lower scores in community support, ecosystem, and team familiarity affect its total score.

## Recommendation:
Based on this weighted decision matrix, **React** is the most suitable choice for our project. Its high scores across all categories, particularly in performance, backend integration, and team familiarity, make it well-suited for developing our blockchain-based ticketing system's front-end.
